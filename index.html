    <p class="thanks">Thank you so much for using Bark! It was an amazing journey to build and meet other gamers who also had issues with reliable voice when gaming!</p>
    <p>Thankfully now many of the problems Bark set out to achieve have been solved by many other tools, and with that I would like to take some time to step away from Bark and focus more on developing great experiences in eSports at <a href="http://riotgames.com">Riot Games</a>.</p>
    <p>Thanks,</p>
